        <p class="rev__description">There's never been an electric scooter quite like this. Speed past traffic at 24 mph. Go up to 22 miles on a single charge. You'll get there in no time at all. Stop and go with the roll of your thumb. Its intuitive design means thereâ€™s almost no learning curve.
